# The JavaScript Syllabus
 
The following courses below are all free. Complete the courses in the following order. Don't skip when you get stuck; instead ask for help. Do all the problems. (Nobody learned how to swim by just watching someone else do it in a video or talk about swimming.)
 
## Prerequisites
 
- Create a free account at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
- Create a free account at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
- *Install a text editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- *Install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime.
  
    _*Steps not required, but recommended so you can run and practice JavaScript code locally on your machine._
 
## Courses
_Some of the material may seem redundant. However, the point is too re-affirm what you learn in one part of a section in another._
 
## Computer and Internet Fundamentals
Platform: Youtube
 
1. Watch this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpl7k8IOT6E) from Harvard's CS50; this video will lay the foundation for computational theory and programming fundamentals.
(This is the actual lecture given to Harvard students.)
 
2. Read this [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) from the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) for a high-level overview of web technologies.

## Part I - Programming Fundamentals and Beginning JavaScript
Part one will introduce you to programming fundamentals that can translate across diffferent languages. You'll learn about variables, data types, control flow and the  object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, as well as a bit of practice with Regular Expressions. You'll find yourself repeating some topics but this is necessary to re-affirm what you've learned. You'll learn "older" Javascript, which is what most browsers still use today before learning the "modern" and better approach to programming in Javascript.

Supplemental: You should follow along and use as a reference Chapters 1 - 10 in Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). This gives a bit more in depth under-the-hood explanation of the language, and all concepts are explained with ES6 syntax.

## Part I.A - The "Glue"
_If you have a good understanding on the how to use the CLI, text editors, IDE's, and other tooling, feel free to skip this section._
Platform: open MIT - no account required
[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

Complete all ten lectures and exercises at the end of each lecture. This will introduce you the CLI (Command Line Interface) or what's commonly referred to as the "shell." In addition, you'll learn some shell scripting, you'll be introduced to Git, a source control version utility tool, and briefly how to debug your code, finishing with a high-level security and cryptography overview necessary for everyday computing.

## Part I.B - HTML, CSS and Git/Github
_If you already have a good understand of HTML, CSS and Git/Github, you can proceed to Part II. Otherwise, complete the following courses before proceeding._

Platform: freeCodeCamp - [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)

_Complete this entire module on freeCodeCamp_.

Platform: Udacity - [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

Platform: Udacity - [Github & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)
 
Platform: Youtube/freeCodeCamp
 
Watch this [introduction to API's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us) video and follow along where applicable.
 
 
## Part II - Advanced JavaScript
Now that you understand a good amount of programming fundamentals and JavaScript, it's time to apply that knowledge to the web - the very reason JavaScript was first created. Part II assumes you understand HTML, CSS, and other aspects of web development, like Git and Github. If these items are unclear to you, complete the previous sub-section I.A before proceeding to Section 4.
 
### Section 4:
Platform: Udacity - [JavaScript And The DOM](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-and-the-dom--ud117)
 
### Section 5:
Platform: Udacity - [Asynchronous JavaScript Requests](https://www.udacity.com/course/asynchronous-javascript-requests--ud109)

## Part III - Web Development

 - Watch all the videos from Ben Eater on [how the Internet works](https://eater.net/inet).
 - Web Layout
   - Refresh your CSS by playing the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) game.
   - Refresh your web layout knowledge by playing the [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) and [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) games.
   - Watch this video on powerful, modern web layout designs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm0IfG1GyZU

   Complete all the modules in the Full Stack Open curriculum.
   This will introduce you to React, the front-end framework javascript library created by Facebook. It will use modern, functional programming with React, and then teach Node.js, Express (server-side JavaScript library), GraphQL (API design) and MongoDB (document style, non-relation DB schema).
